# Cheese Squeeze Game
 Game to test UI and Particle Systems
 
 I was testing out how to increase an on screen slider on a key input and have the slider degrade over time. 
 I also linked it to a particle system. 

This was an early prototype to test how I could link these together. 

I aim to come back and make it into a playable demo.
